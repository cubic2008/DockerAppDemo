# DockerApp Demo

## Introduction
This repository is created for demonstrating how to build and deploy a typical fullstack project in the docker environment.

In this demon, we will setup two environments for two typical applications. Each environment contains a front-end application, back-end service (A REST API server), and a database server
* The first environment contains the following three components:
  - Front-end application: implemented using Angular framework
  - Backend REST API server: implemented using SpringBoot 2
  - Database server: implemented using MySQL 8.x
* The second environment contains the following three components:
  - Front-end application: implemented using Angular framework
  - Backend REST API server: implemented using SpringMVC that is deployed on Tomcat
  - Database server: implemented using MySQL 8.x

The following diagrams illustrate the two environments.
